    blogParagraph: `Creating any type of video project is a long process with many important stages and one of the most important steps in creating the final cut of your project is the video editing process. The editing phase of your video is an important step in video production. Once you have all your footage and all the audio you've recorded, it's time to edit it into something manageable. There are three reasons why video editing is so important.
    

    
    `,

    blogFirstSubtitle: "1) Review All Images and Audio",
    blogFirstParagraph: ` The video editing process allows you to look at everything you captured while shooting. While shooting, it's easy to overlook certain shots you've created because of how quickly a movie set plays out. The editing process allows you to slow down and carefully review all the content you need to work with so you can formulate a way to bring it all together.`,
    blogSecondSubtitle: `Increase your customer pool;`,
    blogSecondSubtitle: "2) Create or Cut a Video",
    blogSecondParaghraph: `The editing stage is where you can create or cut your video. This is where all the content you have comes together in a meaningful way. This is where you turn disparate clips into a unifying story. Sometimes you won't even think about it, but in the editing room, they're alive. This is also where you make big decisions about coloring, visual effects, transitions and more.`,
    blogThirdSubtitle: "3) Creative Decisions",
    blogThirdParagraph: `A well-organized project will flow clearly and with great precision. All the creative decisions you've made from pre-production through post-production have been completely changed after they've been finalized. This is the process by which you decide to speed up the film and how all the shots work together to form a unified whole.

     Video editing is a lengthy process on its own and pays great attention to detail. It's never a bad idea to hire a video editing service for your project because you know you'll get professional results every time.
